Andre's PMR Utilities
=====================

This repository houses various utilities that I've developed to do things with data and knowledge housed in the Physiome Model Repository (https://models.physiomeproject.org).

pmr_mx_fmt.py
-------------

This is an initial attempt at exporting model information from PMR into the OmicsDI format needed for the ModeleXchange prototype.
See [`x_run.md`](x_run.md) for an example on how to use this tool.

workspaces.py
-------------

Code to try and pull knowledge out of workspaces and put it into a format / collection that is more useful.
